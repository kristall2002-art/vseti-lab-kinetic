**Use this template** — copy the source into a new project:

```bash
npx degit bswxyz/formwork-aurelis my-app
```


**Live demo → https://bswxyz.github.io/formwork-aurelis/** · [How it was built](https://bswxyz.github.io/formwork-aurelis/guide/)

> A house of scent, rendered as living light: a full-screen fluid-noise aurora that never repeats.

A free, MIT-licensed website template. Good for: **perfume & beauty brands, candle makers, boutique cosmetics, any sensory product**.
The demo brand ("AURELIS") is fictional — every word and colour is meant to be replaced with yours.

## The signature technique

- Hand-written WebGL fragment shader — domain-warped fractal noise (fBm) flowing through a three-colour palette
- Masked headline reveal, scroll reveals (GSAP), custom cursor, animated film grain
- Product cards with per-card gradient glows and a 'scent spectrum' hover strip

## Use this as your own site

This repo is a **template** — everything is plain HTML/CSS/JS with **relative paths**, so it
works under *any* repo name with zero configuration.

1. Click **Use this template → Create a new repository** (top of this page).
   **Name it whatever you like** — `my-site`, `portfolio`, anything.
2. In your new repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**,
   then pick `main` / `/ (root)` and save. (CLI: see below.)
3. Wait ~1 minute. Your site is live at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/`.

<details>
<summary>Prefer the command line?</summary>

```bash
gh repo create my-site --template bswxyz/formwork-aurelis --public --clone
cd my-site
gh api --method POST /repos/YOUR-USERNAME/my-site/pages \
  -f 'source[branch]=main' -f 'source[path]=/'
```
</details>

No build step, no dependencies to install — edit the files, push, done.
The only external requests are Google Fonts and (where used) pinned CDN copies of GSAP/three.js.

## Customize it

- Aurora colours: edit the three `vec3` palette stops (`A`, `B`, `C`) inside the shader in `main.js`
- Brand palette & type: everything lives in the `:root` variables at the top of `styles.css`
- Products: duplicate a `.card` in `index.html` and set its `--a/--b/--c` glow colours inline

The `/guide/` page documents the signature technique in depth (with code) — keep it, rewrite it,
or delete the folder entirely.

## Files

```
index.html        the page
styles.css        all styling (design tokens in :root at the top)
main.js           the signature effect + motion
guide/index.html  how-it-works write-up (optional — yours to keep or delete)
```

## Built-in quality

- Works with JS disabled or a CDN failure (content is never permanently hidden)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; keyboard focus styles throughout
- Canvas/WebGL feature-detected with graceful fallbacks; devicePixelRatio capped for performance
- Responsive at phone / tablet / desktop widths
